- 👋 Hi, I’m @pluvio72
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Web Dev and Game Dev primarily, those are the sectors that brought me my love of programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning specifically Generative networks (GANs) as they have crazy potential and I would like to get more use out of them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project called UpLifting.
